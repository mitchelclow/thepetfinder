            <b>Q. What area can I use The Pet Finder¬Æ in?</b>
            <br>
            A. We allow users to post within the Denver Metro area.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Q. What do I do if I find a lost pet that doesn't have a collar?</b>
            <br>
            A. Carefully approach the animal. Your safety should always come first. Don't approach a vicious or unwelcoming animal. When in doubt, call Animal Contorl or your local police station to help the scared animal.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Q. I've safely rescued the lost pet. It seems domesticated, but there isn't a collar. How do I help them get home?</b>
            <br>
            A. Once the pet is in a safe place, bring them immediately to the nearest vet to have them scanned for a microchip. The longer you keep the pet away from its home, the more worried its parents will be!
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Q. What is a microchip? How does it work?</b>
            <br>
            A. The only way to tell if an animal is microchipped is to bring it to a licensed vet. There, they have the ability to scan the animal's neck to see if there is a microchip already inserted. If so, the pet's chip will be registered to an owner, whom the vet will be able to help you contact.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Q. I've brought the pet to the vet, but there isn't a microchip. What now?</b>
            <br>
            A. Use our <a href="ifound.html">"I found a lost pet"</a> form to submit the information as accurately as possible for the owners to use to try and find their pet again.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Q. Help! I've lost my pet and didn't get them a microchip!</b>
            <br>
            A. Don't worry, that's where our <a href="ilost.html">"I lost my pet"</a> form comes in handy. Post your pets information with a recent photo, including the last place you saw them. Include means to contact you should your pet be found so that you can bring Fido home. We know how scary this process can be, but with the proper resources and keeping an eye out for our furry friends, we can all help return our fur babies to their homes.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Q. I've kept the lost pet for a reasonable amount of time. What do I do if no one claims the pet?</b>
            <br>
            A. <a href="adopt.html">We offer an adoption service for dogs in the Denver Metro area</a>. If you have a pet that hasn't been claimed in what you believe is a reasonable amount of time, feel free to contact us at the email address petfinderadopt@gmail.com to talk with us about posting the pet for adoption.
            <br>
            <br>
             <b>Q. I miss the pet, and although I've given it back to its owner, I want one of my own. Would you suggest any place to adopt a pet?</b>
            <br>
            A. The Pet Finder offers adoption services for pets submitted to our website for a reasonable amount of time, along with others that were brought in to our clinic. Email petfinderadopt@gmail.com for more information on where to find our adoption clinic, and the process of adopting any of the pets listed on our <a href="adopt.html">Adopt-a-Pet page</a>.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Q. What if I have a question that's not listed here?</b>
            <br>
            A. Use our contact forum below to leave us a message with your question, and we'll make sure to get back to you as soon as possible. If you have a life or limb threatening emergency, dial 911 immediately.
